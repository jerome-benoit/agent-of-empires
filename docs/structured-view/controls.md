# Modes, Approvals & Model Controls

The composer footer is where you steer a structured view session: the permission
mode decides what runs without asking, approval cards gate the rest, and
(when the adapter advertises them) model and reasoning-effort selectors
tune the agent itself. For the surrounding UI, see
[Structured view Interface](interface.md).

## Permission modes and YOLO

Structured view sessions run in one of the permission modes advertised by the
ACP adapter. The composer's mode picker shows whatever the agent
reports in its `NewSessionResponse.modes`; for `claude-agent-acp` the
typical set is:

| Mode id              | Meaning                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `default`            | Every Write/Edit/Bash routes through an approval card.                  |
| `acceptEdits`        | Edit-kind tools auto-approved; Bash and unknown tools still prompt.     |
| `bypassPermissions`  | All tools auto-approved. The structured view analogue of YOLO.                  |
| `plan`               | Read-only; the agent drafts a plan but does not run side-effectful tools. |

Other adapters report their own ids. Gemini (over `gemini --acp`) uses
the gemini-cli `ApprovalMode` names: `auto_edit` folds onto `acceptEdits`
semantics and `yolo` onto `bypassPermissions`, so a Gemini session is
classified the same as the equivalent `claude-agent-acp` mode.

### YOLO mode maps to `bypassPermissions`

When `[session] yolo_mode_default = true` (or the wizard's "Auto-approve
actions" toggle is on), structured view asks the adapter to start the session
in `bypassPermissions` immediately after `session/new`. This mirrors
what the tmux view does by appending
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` to the Claude CLI argv.

The wiring is best-effort: the structured view fires `session/set_mode` after
the handshake and continues regardless of the response. If the adapter
accepts, the mode picker flips to `bypassPermissions` and you stop
seeing approval cards. If it rejects (see next section), a non-blocking
amber notice appears above the composer with the adapter's reason and
the session keeps running in whichever mode it landed on.

### `bypassPermissions` may not be available

`claude-agent-acp` gates `bypassPermissions` on the `ALLOW_BYPASS`
environment variable. If the daemon spawned the adapter without
`ALLOW_BYPASS=1` in its env, `session/set_mode("bypassPermissions")`
returns "Mode bypassPermissions is not available" and the session
stays in `default`. Two ways out:

1. Restart `aoe serve` with `ALLOW_BYPASS=1` so the adapter advertises
   the mode. The structured view then drives it automatically on every new
   YOLO-mode session.
2. Live with `default` and approve as you go, or pick `acceptEdits`
   from the composer mode picker for edit-only auto-approval.

The Auto-approve toggle in the wizard does not configure
`ALLOW_BYPASS`; the env var is a daemon-process input set wherever
`aoe serve` actually launches.

## Approvals

When the agent wants to run a tool that requires approval, the structured view
shows an approval card:

- **Benign tools** (read, search, list): single tap on a primary
  button.
- **Destructive tools** (`rm -rf`, `git push --force`, writes to
  system paths): long-press 800ms with a progress ring and a haptic
  confirmation. Single tap is reserved for the deny button.

You can configure how structured view classifies destructive operations and
the timeout before a pending approval auto-cancels:

```toml
[acp]
approval_timeout_secs = 300
destructive_require_double_confirm = true
```

The card clears as soon as your decision is accepted, rather than waiting
on the broadcast that confirms it. If the approval already resolved on the
daemon (a concurrent decision, the silent-tool watchdog, or the agent
offering no option matching your choice), resolving it again clears the
card quietly instead of surfacing an error. This holds on both the web
dashboard and the native TUI cockpit.

### Notifications and sound

When an approval lands, the structured view fires two channels so a user away
from the dashboard still sees the agent is blocked:

- **Web push.** If the PWA is installed and notifications are
  enabled, the daemon sends an OS-level push tagged
  `acp-approval-<session>`. Tapping the notification deep-links
  back to the structured view. Unlike status-change pushes, approval pushes
  are not suppressed when the dashboard or TUI is active; the service
  worker routes focused clients to an in-app toast instead of an OS
  banner. See [Push notifications](../push-notifications.md).
- **Browser sound.** The structured view plays a chime in the dashboard tab
  whenever pending approvals go from zero to non-zero. Configure the
  file via `[sound] on_approval` in the daemon config or the Sound
  category of the Settings TUI. The chime is independent of the
  host-side audio used by the tmux status flow; the structured view case
  often runs `aoe serve` on a remote box and the host speaker would
  be on the wrong side of the wire.

## Model and reasoning effort

Structured view sessions render two extra selectors in the composer footer
beside the mode pill when the ACP adapter advertises them: a model
dropdown and a reasoning-effort selector. Both come from one wire
mechanism, ACP `SessionUpdate::ConfigOptionUpdate`, stabilised
upstream in `claude-agent-acp` v0.37.0 (Opus 4.8 added in v0.38.0).
The adapter emits the full
snapshot of every selector (mode, model, reasoning effort, future
categories) whenever any one of them changes; the structured view replaces
its cached list in full.

### When the pickers appear

The pickers only render if the adapter publishes the matching
category. `claude-agent-acp` v0.39.0+ advertises a model selector
for every session, and adds a reasoning-effort selector when the
current model reports `supportsEffort=true`. Older adapters that
emit no `config_option_update` show neither picker; this is by
design so non-Claude backends don't grow empty UI chrome.

### Model via the unstable `session_model` channel

Some adapters advertise the model not as a `config_option` but through
the ACP `unstable_session_model` capability: a `SessionModelState`
(current model plus available models) on the `session/new` and
`session/load` response, switched with `session/set_model`. Cockpit
reads that channel too and normalizes it into the same model dropdown,
so it looks and behaves identically regardless of which channel the
agent uses. If an agent exposes the model on both channels, the
`config_option` one wins (it has a push/echo path; `session/set_model`
only acks), so the UI never shows two model dropdowns. Because
`session/set_model` returns no model-state echo, cockpit synthesizes
the confirming update itself after the switch is acknowledged.

### Setting a value

Clicking an option fires `POST /api/sessions/{id}/acp/config-option`
with `{ config_id, value }` which the structured view supervisor turns into
ACP `session/set_config_option`. The UI is pessimistic: the chip
still shows the previous current value while the request is in
flight, with a subtle dim and a disabled re-click on the just-clicked
option, until the adapter pushes a confirming `config_option_update`.
This avoids "snap back" on slow networks (Cloudflare Tunnel can run
300-800ms round trips).

### The `Default` reasoning effort

The reasoning-effort dropdown includes a `Default` option alongside
adapter-supported levels like `Low | Medium | High`. `Default` is
not a fixed effort; the SDK resolves it per current model. Picking
it explicitly tells the adapter to drop any session-level effort
pin so the model uses its default reasoning budget. See upstream
PR agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp#701.

### When a switch fails

If the adapter rejects `session/set_config_option` (rate limit,
missing capability, transient error), an amber non-blocking notice
appears next to the composer with the configured selector name, the
rejected value, and the adapter's reason. The notice auto-dismisses
when a later snapshot reports the originally-requested value as
current (the user retried and won, or the adapter applied the value
asynchronously). The session keeps running in whichever value the
adapter last confirmed.

### Lifecycle clears

The cached selector list clears on `AgentSwitched` (a Claude-to-Codex
handoff invalidates Claude-specific models) but survives `/clear`:
adapter capabilities are process-scoped, not conversation-scoped.
