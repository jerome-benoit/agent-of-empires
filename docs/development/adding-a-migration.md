# Adding a data migration

Breaking changes to stored data (file locations, config schema) go through `src/migrations/`, not inline fallback/compat shims. A `.schema_version` file tracks state; `migrations::run_migrations()` runs pending ones in order on startup and bumps the version.

A migration whose work is large and per-session may leave rows pending rather than doing all of it at startup. v027 is the example: it stamps the version at first upgrade, then moves each session's store when that session next needs a container, with `aoe migrate` as the bulk path. If you write one of these, the startup pass must be cheap and the deferred work must have a trigger a user reaches without knowing it exists.

To add one:

1. Create `src/migrations/vNNN_description.rs` with a `pub fn run() -> anyhow::Result<()>`.
2. In `src/migrations/mod.rs`: add `mod vNNN_description;`, bump `CURRENT_VERSION`, append a `(NNN, "description", vNNN_description::run)` entry to the `MIGRATIONS` table.

Migrations must be idempotent, use `tracing::info!`, gate platform-specific ones with `#[cfg(target_os = "...")]`, and be tested by hand-crafting the old state.

A migration that retypes a persisted field must call `crate::session::backup_before_migration` before rewriting, so the build that predates the new shape still has bytes it can read. What that build does with a row it cannot decode, and what the recovery backup is worth to a user who forces a downgrade, is covered under [Downgrading](../installation.md#downgrading).
