//! Focus model + key dispatch for the structured view.
//!
//! The view is meant to feel like a native coding agent. The composer
//! is the home base: the view lands there so you can type immediately,
//! and reading history never requires a focus switch (the mouse wheel
//! and `PageUp`/`PageDown` scroll the transcript from the composer).
//! `Ctrl-Q` leaves the view, mirroring live-send's exit chord; `Esc` is
//! an agent-style interrupt (it cancels a generating turn, and is a
//! no-op when idle), never an exit. The transcript is a secondary focus
//! reached with `Tab` for its power keys (scroll, mode picker, browser,
//! elicitation answers); `Esc` there returns to the composer. The
//! composer captures **every** typed key, including `a`/`A`/`d`, so
//! typing "always allow" into a prompt never resolves an approval. A
//! pending approval opens a modal shelf and then accepts `a`/`A`/`d`.
