 * Anchor comments against the raw old/new contents fed to the

 *
 * Unlike the hunk-based {@link anchorComments}, any line that exists in the
 * current file can host an annotation, so a comment is `active` whenever its
 * range is in-bounds for its side and `stale` only when the range no longer
 * fits the file. `hunkIndex`/`endRowIndex` are not used on this path; the
 * renderer places the annotation from `comment.side`/`comment.endLine`.
