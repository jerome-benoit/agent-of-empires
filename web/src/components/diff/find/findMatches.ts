/**
 * In-diff find that searches a supplied set of lines (the diff *model*), not
 * the rendered DOM.
 *
 * The diff is rendered with a virtualized renderer (`@pierre/diffs`), so
 * off-screen lines are not in the DOM and the browser's native Cmd+F can't
 * reach them. Searching the model lets find/next/prev jump to a match anywhere
 * in the diff; the caller then scrolls the renderer to it.
 *
 * Callers pass exactly the lines that should be searchable; for the MVP, the
 * changed (added/deleted) lines of the diff (see `changedLines`), so find only
 * matches content that's actually part of the change, not the whole file.
