TUI QA Test Results - Theme System
===================================
Date: Thu Feb 19 2026
Platform: Linux
Binary: ./target/release/aoe (release build)

BUG DISCOVERED AND FIXED
------------------------
SettingsCategory::Theme was NOT included in the categories vec in 
src/tui/settings/mod.rs lines 128-136. Theme category was missing
from the Settings TUI. Fixed by adding SettingsCategory::Theme as
the first element.

TEST 1: Theme Selection [PASS]
------------------------------
- Navigated to Settings (press 's')
- Theme category now appears FIRST in category list
- Available themes shown in dropdown: phosphor, tokyo-night, catppuccin-latte
- Dropdown uses < > selector pattern when focused

Evidence:
```
| > Theme          || Theme                               |
|   Session        || Color theme for the TUI             |
|   Hooks          || phosphor < >                        |
```

TEST 2: Immediate Update [PASS]
-------------------------------
- Selected tokyo-night theme via Enter key (cycles options)
- Settings title showed '*' indicating unsaved changes
- Pressed Ctrl+s to save
- "Settings saved" message displayed
- Theme value updated immediately

Evidence:
```
  Settings *    [ Global ]  [ Profile: default ]
  ...
  tokyo-night < >
  ...
  Settings saved
```

TEST 3: Persistence [PASS]
--------------------------
- Quit aoe with 'q'
- Verified config.toml contains:
  [theme]
  name = "tokyo-night"
- Restarted aoe
- Navigated to Settings
- Theme still shows "tokyo-night"

Evidence (from config.toml):
```
[theme]
name = "tokyo-night"
```

TEST 4: Fallback [PASS]
-----------------------
- Manually edited config.toml to set name = "invalid-theme-xyz"
- Started aoe
- Application did NOT crash
- Fell back to "phosphor" theme (default)
- Settings showed "phosphor" as current theme

Evidence:
```
| > Theme          || Theme                               |
|   Session        || Color theme for the TUI             |
|   Hooks          || phosphor                            |
```

SUMMARY
-------
Theme Selection [PASS]
Immediate Update [PASS]
Persistence [PASS]
Fallback [PASS]

VERDICT: APPROVE

NOTES:
- Config restored to valid state (phosphor) after testing
